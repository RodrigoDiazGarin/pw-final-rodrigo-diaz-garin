                <h2>Mr. Incredible</h2>
                <p>Once a legendary superhero, Mr. Incredible now works at an insurance company, feeling
                    disconnected
                    from his family and his past glory. But he'll soon discover that his greatest adventure is with
                    them.</p>

                <p>Helen Parr has left her superhero days behind to focus on her family. Though she occasionally
                    uses
                    her powers at home, she's happy with a quiet life — and wishes Bob felt the same.</p>

                    Though his hero days are behind him, he still supports Bob and brings his cool-headed style wherever
                    he goes.</p>

                <p>Syndrome is a brilliant but bitter villain who, despite lacking superpowers, uses his intelligence
