                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a will of steel to hide your superhero talents from a world that still needs you,
                    yet no longer appreciates what you can do. Battling a bulging belly and a boring job, Mr. Incredible
                    longs for the glory days of upholding law and order while his superhuman family tries to fit in with
                    their "normal" life. Relief from quiet suburbia finally comes years later, when the family uncovers
                    a diabolical plan and must bring together their respective strengths to save the day.

                <h2>Superpowers</h2>
                <p>
                    The Parr family's superpowers were based on their personalities. As a dad, Bob had to be the
                    strong one, and mom Helen had to handle being pulled in all directions. Violet, the insecure teen,
                    doesn't want people to look at her, while Dash represents a typical hyperactive boy. And baby
                    Jack-Jack is all about undiscovered potential.

                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>
                    The world of The Incredibles evokes the future as imagined in the early 1960s. Pixar
                    designers found inspiration in television shows like Jonny Quest, the early James Bond pictures, and
                    Walt Disney's original Tomorrowland.
